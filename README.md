Bussines Process modelling Painting School
Consider the scenario of a painting school that needs to manage student
requests. The student contacts the school and receives a list of available
courses. The student selects a course and is put in contact with an instructor.
The instructor proposes a date and location for the first lesson, and the
student can accept or suggest a different date and location, continuing this
way until an appointment is set. Before each meeting, the student receives
a list of techniques and tools to get acquainted with before they are used in
the lesson. During the meeting, the student prepares a series of sketches and
drafts: the instructor explains each step of the process, the student follows
the instructions, and, in case of doubts, asks the instructor for advice. At the
end of each meeting, one of the drafts is selected for the student to complete
at home, digitalize, and send to the instructor. The selection of the draft
to complete is proposed by the instructor until the student agrees. After
making an electronic payment to the school, the student and instructor can
arrange a new appointment (following the process described above), or the
student may decide to conclude the course. If the course is completed, the
client informs the school, and the process ends.
Design appropriate processes that faithfully reflect the scenario described
above and ensure compatibility.
Modify the processes so that at the end of the course, the student can
choose whether to begin a new learning journey
